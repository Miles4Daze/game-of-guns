## Dependancies
Turbowarp, Penguin, or some other scratch mod that automatically loads custom extensions from extensions.turbowarp.org. <br/>
(UNTESTED) Alternatively, you could download the extensions used, use a scratch mod that lets you load extensions from a URL or file, and then import the extensions. <br/>
* Extensions: <br/>
  - https://extensions.turbowarp.org/cursor.js <br/>
  - https://extensions.turbowarp.org/DT/cameracontrols.js <br/>
  - https://extensions.turbowarp.org/true-fantom/couplers.js <br/>
  - https://extensions.turbowarp.org/obviousAlexC/newgroundsIO.js <br/>
  - https://extensions.turbowarp.org/Lily/TempVariables2.js <br/>

## Instructions

*To load .sb3.zip releases, remove ".zip"!*
